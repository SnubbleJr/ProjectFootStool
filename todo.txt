Design visuals round music
	Ask Alex what themes he used, what influenced it, what feel he thinks it is
		also ask if i can get beat info avaible in the file

make a propper menu and post match screen now

with the music, make it look more jazzy, hotline miami-y?
maybe glow shaders or changing background colour, more wire frames and neony?
	80's inside of a computer, like the new feed dump/blood dragon/tron looks
	feel like fighting inside of a computer

main menu has a scrolling background of circuits, hovering over an option changes the direction
		(bit like virus named tom?)
	start from the standard flag, when start is pressed, tilt the camera and start moving the background
		make a script that generates background tiles that is never ending
			when a game starts, build out the tiles into a square, and stop the movement

	will have to implement a propper menu system, see if i can use 1080's?
		will have to make a handeler who who has control
	background pulse with beat

screen shake on kill?

swinky swanky swaggy neon jazz

look into:
starwhales
virus named tom
